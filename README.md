# silverstripeltd/search-service-bifrost

Integrate your Silverstripe CMS with Silverstripe's search service.

## Other modules

* [Add support for querying](https://github.com/silverstripeltd/discoverer-bifrost)
* [Default theme for search form interfaces](https://github.com/silverstripeltd/discoverer-theme)

## Installation

Add the following to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:silverstripeltd/search-service-bifrost.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then run the following:

```shell
composer require silverstripeltd/search-service-bifrost
```

## Activating the service

To start using the Silverstripe Bifr√∂st, define environment variables containing your endpoint, and engine prefix, and
private API key.

```
BIFROST_ENDPOINT="https://abc123.app-search.ap-southeast-2.aws.found.io:443"
BIFROST_ENGINE_PREFIX="index-name-excluding-variant"
BIFROST_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY="APIKEY123"
```

## Configuration

The most notable configuration surface is the schema, which determines how data is stored in your index. There are four
types of data supported:

* `text` (default)
* `date`
* `number`
* `geolocation`
* `binary` (only supported for the `_attachment` field - see below)

You can specify these data types in the `options` node of your fields.

```yaml
SilverStripe\Forager\Service\IndexConfiguration:
  indexes:
    myindex:
      includeClasses:
        SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
          fields:
            title: true
            summary_field:
              property: SummaryField
              options:
                type: text
```

### File attachments for content extraction

The Silverstripe Search Service supports content extraction for PDF and Docx files. These can be attached to your
Document using an `_attachment` field of type `binary`.

This field needs to contain a base 64 encoded string of binary for the file you wish to process.

```yaml
SilverStripe\Forager\Service\IndexConfiguration:
  indexes:
    myindex:
      includeClasses:
        SilverStripe\Assets\File:
          fields:
            title: true
            _attachment:
              property: getBase64String
              options:
                type: binary
```

Where `getBase64String` is a method in our `FileExtension` - which has already been applied to your `File` class.
